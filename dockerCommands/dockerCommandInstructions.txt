RUN - Execute commands in a new Layer and commits the results
ADD/COPY - Adds files and folders into image
CMD - Runs binaries/commands on docker run
ENTRYPOINT - Allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.

VOLUME - Creates a mount point and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes.
EXPOSE - cointainer listens on the specified network ports at runtime.


ENV - Sets the environment variable

WORKDIR - sets the working directory
ARG - Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time
